# Concepts 

Some Object Oriented concepts 

### Declare vs define
- Declare = something with this name and type exist. Not the information the variable stores
- Define. Assign data to a variable. 

### Static
- Variable exists for all instances of a class.
- 

### Interface 
- All public, static, and final
- Declares methods and public variables without the implementation 
- Methods must be implemented by a class that 'implements' the interface. 

### Class
- 

### Abstraction

### Methods
- Class Methods
	- Instance Methods
		- Called on an instance/an object of a class
		- objectName.instanceMethod();


### Abstract class 
- Allows private variables 
- An incomplete class
- Any sub class must implement all the methods or be declared abstract itself. 


### Abstraction
- Hiding data
- How an interface just shows the methods
- We don't know the components , we just know the parameters and results
